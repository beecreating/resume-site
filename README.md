Iida Puomila – Personal Resume Website

A clean, Apple-inspired, modern resume website built with TypeScript, Node/Express, and TailwindCSS.
Showcases my skills, projects, and personality in a minimal yet polished and professional way. Personal gitHub is very empty unlike the school's one, but trying to get better at show casing my passion here too.
